This directory is expected to contain tabulated x-ray mass attenuation coefficients for chemical elements from:

[1] J. Hubbell and S. M. Seltzer, 'Tables of X-Ray Mass Attenuation Coefficients and Mass Energy-Absorption Coefficients from 1 keV to 20 MeV for Elements Z = 1 to 92 and 48 Additional Substances of Dosimetric Interest', NIST Standard Reference Database 126 (1996) https://dx.doi.org/10.18434/T4D01F (accessed on 05/07/2022)

It is assumed that there are separate files for each chemical element, which are called 'ZZ.txt'.
'ZZ' is the zero-padded proton number of the element, i.e. the file for hydrogen would be called '01.txt'.
The format of the files is the 'ASCII format' of the table in Ref. [1].
