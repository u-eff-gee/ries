This directory is expected to contain a file called 'elements.txt' with chemical-element properties in the 'Linearized ASCII Output' format from Ref. [1, 2], which is a compilation of data from Refs. [3-5].

[2] The original file contains entries for deuterium and tritium, which prevent a simple parsing of the file. Here, tritium, which is not contained in natural hydrogen, was removed, and the 'Atomic Symbol' of deuterium was changed from 'D' to 'H'.
