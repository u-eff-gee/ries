Module for storing properties of nuclear states.

Any state with an index :math:`i`
(:math:`i = 0` denotes the ground state, :math:`i > 0` denotes an excited state)
of a nucleus is characterized by its:

* total angular momentum quantum number ('spin') :math:`J_i`
* parity quantum number :math:`\pi_i`
* excitation energy :math:`E_i`

Here, it is assumed that if :math:`i > j`, then :math:`E_i > E_j`.
In addition, if the state is not the ground state [c]_, it has the properties:

* total width :math:`\Gamma_i`
* partial widths for the decay to lower-lying states :math:`\Gamma_{i \to j}` (:math:`j < i`)

All state objects (`GroundState`, `State`) have an attribute `J_pi` which is supposed to be their
unique identifier.
For example, the states may simply be labeled by their energies, i.e. the ground state is `0`,
the first excited state is `1`, and so on.
In the examples of `ries`, the states are labeled by their spin, parity, and the index of that
combination, i.e. the third state with a spin 2 and a positive parity would be `J_pi = '2^+_3'`.
With these unique identifiers, the partial widths can be implemented as a dictionary with the key
`J_pi` (see `tests/boron.py` for a detailed example).

By itself, the `State` class makes no assumptions about the units of its properties, but it is
recommended to give energies and widths in :math:`\mathrm{MeV}`.

.. [c] For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that the ground state has no decays, which is
  of course not true in reality.
  However, since photonuclear reactions with real photons are often only feasible with (quasi-)
  stable nuclei, this is a valid approximation.
